## Core domain

### Three roles (`dashboard/layout.js` NAV map)
- **Admin** — all pages including Master Setup
- **Accountant** — entry, pos, customers, staff, materials, menu-config, branches, leaves
- **Employee** — dashboard, day-working, my-payroll, apply-leave

Role gate: `useCurrentUser().role` === "admin" | "accountant" | "employee".

### Entries vs Invoices — rollup relationship
- **`invoices`** — one doc per bill (POS). Statuses: `"draft" | "settled"`. Drafts auto-expire at midnight (subscription filters `date === selDate`). Each settle assigns `invoice_no` = `{BRANCH-PREFIX}-{DDMMYY}-{NNN}` where the sequence is per-branch-per-date.
- **`entries`** — one doc per (`branch_id`, `date`) — the daily rollup. Accountant edits petrol/material_expense/others/actual_cash here. POS settles call `handleSave` with `{ rollup: true }` which auto-targets any existing daily entry (no "Duplicate Detected" prompt).
- **`service_logs`** — per-service lines with `source: "pos" | "manual"` + `invoice_id` + `loan_flag` + `home_branch_id`. Employee's day-working portal reads these.

Settled invoices are never deleted through UI. Treat them as permanent records.

### Loan resource (ad-hoc, per-bill)
Staff from another branch can be "borrowed" for a specific bill or day:
- POS cart staff dropdown groups `This branch` + `Borrow · <home>` optgroups.
- Daily Entry has a `+ Loan Resource` button + search modal (name or branch).
- Every downstream record carries `home_branch_id` + `loan_flag`:
  - `invoices.items[]`, `invoices.staff_split[]`
  - `service_logs`
  - `entries.staff_billing[]` (loan rows appended)
- Intent: **sale attribution** → current branch (loan branch gets incentive + tips). **Salary attribution** → home branch (read `home_branch_id`).
- `LOAN` tag on bill uses `className="no-print"` — customers never see it.

### Walk-in numbering
When `selectedCustomer` is null on POS settle, the invoice gets `walkin_no` = `(count of today's settled walk-ins for this branch) + 1`. Displayed as `Walk-in #NNN` on the bill receipt.

### Customer last-visit
On settle, if bill is linked to a customer, update their doc with `last_visit_date`, `last_visit_at`, `last_visit_invoice`, `last_visit_branch_id`. POS Order Summary shows "last visit N days ago" with tiered colour hint.

## Firestore collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | Login credentials, role, branch, linked staff_id |
| `branches` | Shop master (name, type: mens/unisex, location) |
| `staff` | Name, role, salary, incentive_pct, join/exit, branch_id |
| `staff_transfers` | Mid-month transfer of home branch |
| `entries` | Daily rollup per branch+date (accountant-editable) |
| `invoices` | Per-bill docs with status draft/settled |
| `service_logs` | Per-service lines (pos + manual) |
| `customers` | Directory + denormalised last_visit_* |
| `menus` | Service menu items (groups → items) |
| `materials`, `material_price_history`, `material_allocations` | Stock |
| `leaves` | Leave records incl. source tag |
| `settings/global` | GST %, incentive rates by branch type |
| `day_closures` | Per-staff per-day locked incentive |

## Conventions

- **Branch/date scoping** — all subscriptions that don't need full history query with `where("date", "==" || ">=" / "<=")`. See POS invoices subscription and P&L.
- **`effectiveBranchOnDate(staff, date, transfers)`** is the truth for "where does this staff work on this date" — always use it, never `staff.branch_id` directly.
- **`staffStatusForMonth(staff, mon)`** — drives `active`/`inactive` filters; respects mid-month status changes.
- **Incentive is always `Math.round(...)`** — at source (`updateStaffRow`) and at display. Ditto mat_incentive, staff_total_inc, totals.
- **No-print class** — `.no-print` hides elements during `window.print()` (CSS in globals.css).
- **Loaders** — every `if (loading) return <VLoader fullscreen label="..." />`. Don't write plain "Loading..." strings.
- **Card glow** — `Card` and `StatCard` in `components/ui.jsx` render with a coloured halo (`box-shadow` + tinted border). Branch cards go further: green glow for `n > 0`, red for `n <= 0` (zero-net counts as not-profitable, not neutral). Keep the `n > 0` convention when adding new P&L-coloured surfaces — never `n >= 0`.
- **Branch `n` = Full Net P&L** — in both dashboard and branches `branchData`, `n` subtracts variable + fixed + salary + GST estimate (`iOnline * gst_pct / 100`). This matches the detail view's Full Net P&L KPI, so card border / Profit-Loss filter / table column all agree. Don't compute a GST-less "gross net" for UI colouring.
- **Operational Expenses tabs** — three views: Fixed (editable grid, 6-column `CORE_COLS` + `expense_types` where `category === "fixed"`), Variable (read-only, `expense_types` where `category !== "fixed"`, cells aggregate `daily_expenses` by branch × month × category, click opens drill-down modal), Total (Fixed + Variable + Salary). Edit in the Variable drill-down is admin-only — accountant sees entries read-only. Salary is never exposed to non-admin: mask it in aggregate KPIs, network-row totals, and per-branch row totals alike. `CORE_COLS` is locked to the six master-setup fields every branch has (Shop/Room Rent, Shop/Room Elec, Water, WiFi) — any other fixed cost is an opt-in `expense_types` row added via the "+ Add Column" button (admin only, tags with the current tab's category).
- **Branches → Summary view** — third entry in the view toggle (alongside Cards / Table). Two sub-tabs: "Summary View" (Excel-like Income + Expense pair of tables with Grand P&L card) and "Daily Cash & Online" (two day × branch pivot tables, one for online one for cash). Salary and final P&L stay admin-only (masked with `•••••` for accountant).
- **Dashboard daily chart** — inline SVG bar chart in `DailyBusinessChart` (no chart lib dep). Shows network-wide `online + cash + material_sale` per day for the selected month. Only renders in month mode to avoid 365-bar clutter.
- **Taskpedia** — shared Kanban (To Do / In Progress / Done) in `dashboard/taskpedia/page.js`. Collection `taskpedia` with fields: title, description, image_url, assignee_id, assigned_by_id, due_date, status, started_at, completed_at, date_changes[], read_by_assignee. Anyone (admin + accountant + employee) can create and assign tasks to anyone. Image uploads go to Firebase Storage `taskpedia/{ts}-{name}`. Due-date edits require a reason — the old → new change is pushed to `date_changes` with author + timestamp. Clicking a task card from the assignee's view marks `read_by_assignee = true` which clears the Bell badge. Bell subscribes to `taskpedia where assignee_id == currentUser.id` and filters client-side for unread + not-done so no composite index is needed.
- **BellNotifications sort** — `requested_at` / `created_at` may be Firestore `Timestamp` objects (from `serverTimestamp()` writes) OR ISO strings (from `new Date().toISOString()`). Never call `.localeCompare` directly on these — always go through the `sortKey()` helper in `BellNotifications.jsx` which coerces Timestamp / Date / number / string to a sortable ISO string. Calling `localeCompare` on a Timestamp throws `localeCompare is not a function` and blanks the dashboard.

## Don'ts

- Don't delete settled invoices from the UI — they're permanent audit records.
- Don't bypass `homeBranchOf` / `effectiveBranchOnDate` — transfers break otherwise.
- Don't add negative-number paths to `Actual Cash Counted` — the `onKeyDown` + `onChange` rejects them.
- Don't write "Guest:" on bills — it's "Customer:" (or "Walk-in #NNN").
- Don't print the LOAN tag — it's internal only.
- Don't write docs/comments that just restate what the code does. Only `**Why:**` / `**How to apply:**` lines.
